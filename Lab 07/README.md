# ðŸ“˜ C++ OOP Tasks Project  

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in **C++**, including **compile-time polymorphism** and **operator overloading**.  
Each task is separated into its own header file (`.h`) for modularity, while a single `main.cpp` file integrates and runs all tasks.

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks Overview

### ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Calculator (Compile-time Polymorphism)
- Implements a `Calculator` class.  
- Demonstrates **function overloading** with three `add()` functions.  
- Supports integers, doubles, and different parameter counts.  

### ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Complex Numbers (Operator Overloading)
- Defines a `Complex` class.  
- Overloads the **`+` operator** to add two complex numbers.  
- Displays results in standard complex form (`a + bi`).  

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Distance Equality (Operator Overloading)
- Implements a `Distance` class with private members: **feet** and **inch**.  
- Overloads the **`==` operator** to compare two distances.  
- Displays whether the given distances are equal or not.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
Understand compile-time polymorphism using function overloading.

Implement operator overloading (+ and ==) in C++.

Use constructors, classes, and modular programming with header files.

Gain experience in clean project structuring for better maintainability.
