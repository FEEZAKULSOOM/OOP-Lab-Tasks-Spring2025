# Aggregation vs Composition in C++

This project demonstrates the concepts of **Aggregation** and **Composition** in C++ using simple examples with a **Calculator**, **Students**, and a **Display** class.

## 🔹 Task 1: Aggregation

**Scenario:**  
In a classroom, multiple students solve math problems using a **shared calculator** provided by the teacher.  

- The calculator is **not owned** by any student.  
- Students just use (refer to) the same calculator.  

**Implementation:**  
- `SharedCalculator` provides `add` and `multiply`.  
- `Student` has a reference (`SharedCalculator*`) to use the calculator.

## 🔹 Task 2: Composition

**Scenario:**  
A calculator can perform operations like addition and multiplication but also needs a **display** to show results.  

- The calculator **owns** the display object.  
- Without the calculator, the display cannot exist.  

**Implementation:**  
- `Display` stores and shows the last result.  
- `Calculator` has a `Display` as a **member object**.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Create the files:
   - `aggregation.h`
   - `composition.h`
   - `main.cpp`
2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o program
   ./program
