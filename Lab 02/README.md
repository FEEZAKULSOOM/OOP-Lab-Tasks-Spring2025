📚 **Overview**
This repository contains solutions to four Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) tasks written in C++.
Each task focuses on a key OOP concept such as constructors, constructor overloading, and destructors.

✨**Tasks Included**

**1️⃣ Task 1: Default Constructor — Employee Management System
Class: Employee**

✔Details:

id initialized to 0

name initialized to "Not Assigned"

salary initialized to 0.0

✔Features:

displayDetails() method to show employee information.

✔Objective:
Simulate adding a new employee to the system with default values.

**2️⃣ Task 2: Parameterized Constructor — Bank Account Initialization
Class: BankAccount**

✔Details:

accountNumber initialized to "PK0309800780100"

accountHolder initialized to "Feeza"

balance initialized to 10000

✔Features:

showAccountDetails() method to display account information.

✔Objective:
Mimic how banking systems initialize customer data at the time of account creation.

3️⃣ **Task 3: Constructor Overloading — Rectangle Class
Class: Rectangle**

✔Details:

Default Constructor: sets length = 1.0, width = 1.0

Parameterized Constructor: initializes with two float values

Single-Parameter Constructor: makes a square by setting length = width

✔Features:

area() method to calculate the area.

display() method to show dimensions.

✔Objective:
Demonstrate the concept of constructor overloading.

4️⃣ **Task 4: Destructor — Locker Class
Class: Locker**

✔Details:

Constructor Output: "Locker allocated to customer."

Destructor Output: "Locker returned by customer."

✔Features:

Observe destructor call automatically (stack memory) and manually (heap memory).

✔Objective:
Understand the importance of memory management and destructor behavior.
