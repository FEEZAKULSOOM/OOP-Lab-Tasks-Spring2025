ðŸ“˜ C++ OOP Tasks Project

This project contains three C++ tasks demonstrating the concepts of compile-time polymorphism and operator overloading. Each task is separated into its own header file (.h) for modularity, and a single main.cpp file is used to run all tasks.

ðŸ“‚ File Structure
Task1_Calculator.h   â†’ Compile-time Polymorphism (Function Overloading)
Task2_Complex.h      â†’ Operator Overloading (+ for Complex Numbers)
Task3_Distance.h     â†’ Operator Overloading (== for Distance Equality)
main.cpp             â†’ Runs all tasks together

ðŸ“Œ Tasks Overview

Task 1: Calculator (Compile-time Polymorphism)

Demonstrates function overloading with multiple add() functions.

Supports integers and doubles with different parameter counts.

Task 2: Complex Numbers (Operator Overloading)

Implements a Complex class.

Overloads the + operator to add two complex numbers.

Task 3: Distance Equality (Operator Overloading)

Defines a Distance class with feet and inch.

Overloads the == operator to compare two distances.

ðŸš€ How to Run

Compile the project:

g++ main.cpp -o tasks


Run the program:

./tasks

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

Understanding function overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism).
