# File Pointer Tasks in C++

This project demonstrates the use of **file pointer functions** in C++:
- `tellp()` → Get the current write pointer position.
- `tellg()` → Get the current read pointer position.
- `seekp()` → Move the write pointer to a specific position.
- `seekg()` → Move the read pointer to a specific position.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Task1_tellp.h` → Implementation of `tellp()`
- `Task2_tellg.h` → Implementation of `tellg()`
- `Task3_seekp.h` → Implementation of `seekp()`
- `Task4_seekg.h` → Implementation of `seekg()`
- `main.cpp` → Menu-driven program that calls each task.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the project in **Dev-C++** or any C++ compiler.
2. Compile and run `main.cpp`.
3. Select a task from the menu to see the result.

## 📝 Example Menu
========= FILE POINTER TASKS =========

Task 1: tellp() - Get Write Pointer Position

Task 2: tellg() - Get Read Pointer Position

Task 3: seekp() - Move Write Pointer

Task 4: seekg() - Move Read Pointer

## ✅ Features
- Modularized code (each task in its own `.h` file).
- Easy-to-understand menu.
- Practical demonstration of file handling in C++.
