# Static Members in C++  

This project demonstrates the use of **static data members** and **static member functions** in C++.  
The code is divided into two header files for clarity, and a single `main.cpp` is used to execute both tasks.

## 📌 Task Descriptions

### 🔹 Task 1: Static Data Member
- Declared inside the class but defined outside.
- Shared among all objects of the class.
- Incremented whenever an object is created.

### 🔹 Task 2: Static Member Function
- Can only access static data members.
- Does not have the `this` pointer.
- Called using the class name.

📊 Example Output

=== Task 1: Static Data Member ===
Total objects of class A created so far: 3

=== Task 2: Static Member Function ===
Total objects created so far: 3
✅ Learning Outcome
