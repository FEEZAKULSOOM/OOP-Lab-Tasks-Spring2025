# BankAccount and Inheritance Tasks – C++ OOP

This project demonstrates important Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++ through four structured tasks, each focusing on constructors, memory management, and inheritance.

---

## Task 1: Copy Constructor – Shallow Copy

**Objective:**  
To demonstrate the issue of shallow copying when a class contains dynamically allocated memory.

**Description:**
- A `BankAccount` class is created using a pointer to store the balance.
- Memory is allocated dynamically in the constructor.
- The default copy constructor is used to copy an object.
- Modifying the copied object affects the original due to shared memory.
- The program shows undefined behavior when the destructor is called twice on the same memory location.

---

## Task 2: Copy Constructor – Deep Copy

**Objective:**  
To fix the shallow copy issue by implementing a deep copy constructor.

**Description:**
- The `BankAccount` class is updated to include a deep copy constructor.
- Each object now gets its own separate copy of the balance.
- After copying and modifying one object, the original object remains unaffected.
- The destructor safely deletes the memory, avoiding double deletion or runtime errors.

## Task 3: Single Inheritance

**Objective:**  
To demonstrate how single inheritance works in C++.

**Description:**
- A base class `Person` contains name and age.
- A derived class `Student` adds a roll number and inherits from `Person`.
- The derived class uses base class functions to manage and display data.
- Shows how derived classes can reuse base class logic using inheritance.

## Task 4: Constructor in Inheritance

**Objective:**  
To demonstrate constructor call order in inheritance.

**Description:**
- A base class `Shape` and a derived class `Rectangle` are implemented.
- Constructors are defined in both classes.
- When an object of `Rectangle` is created, the base class constructor is called first automatically.
- This task explains constructor chaining in inheritance.

## How to Run

1. Open any C++ IDE (Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, etc.).
2. Copy the code for each task into a separate `.cpp` file.
3. Compile and run each file to observe the output.
4. These examples are portable and do not require any platform-specific libraries.
